We are dedicated to the principles of equity, inclusivity, and accessibility and want to make sure we support all trainees regardless of their personal attributes. We believe that our diversity makes us better scientists, better citizens and better humans. These principles are described in more detail in the lab's 'Expectations Document' linked below."
