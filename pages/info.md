We are always looking for good people to join the team! Those interested in joining the team can inquire by sending a CV and cover letter to [Patrick Dolan](mailto:Patrick.Dolan@nih.gov).

## Projects include:

* single-cell sequencing of infection in animal models
* deep mutational scanning of viral proteins
* ancestral state reconstruction of viral evolution histories
