The [**Quantitative Virology and Evolution Unit**](https://qveu.github.io/QVEU/) is led by [Patrick Dolan, Ph.D.](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/patrick-t-dolan-phd), Earl Stadtman Tenure-Track Investigator and Unit Chief in the [Laboratory of Viral Diseases](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/lab-viral-diseases), NIH-NIAID, in Bethesda, MD.

Our work is focused on the use of quantitative experimental and computational approaches to understand the roles of heterogeneity, history, and constraint on viral emergence and evolution. In one focus area, we use single-cell sequencing approaches to characterize the responses to infection in cell culture and animal models. We hope to these studies will help us understand within-host evolutionary dynamics, and the determinants of host tropism and pathogenesis. In another focus area, we use phylogenetic tools to reconstruct the evolution of emerging viruses. We then experimentally interrogate these ancestral evolutionary paths with mutational screens to understand how viruses emerge.

Fully-funded postdoctoral positions are available to develop independent projects in single-cell transcriptomics, single-genome viral sequencing, population genetics, phylogenetics and evolutionary biochemistry. Work in a supportive, collegial, and well-resourced environment on a range of viral pathogens and host systems. Those interested in joining the lab should send a CV and cover letter to [Patrick Dolan, Ph.D.](mailto:Patrick.Dolan@nih.gov).

## Projects include:

* Single-cell sequencing of infection in animal models.
* Deep mutational scanning of viral proteins.
* Ancestral state reconstruction of viral evolution histories.
* High content microscopic creening of cell phenotypes.
