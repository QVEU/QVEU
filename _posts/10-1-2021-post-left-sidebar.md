The *QVEU* is officially open! As of October 1, we are officially up and running. We welcomed our first post-bac student, Rebecca Walker. We are busy ordering, installing, plugging-in, and setting-up and will start **science-ing** soon! Get in touch to chat about what we are up to, how we could collaborate, or for post-bac and post-doc positions!
