The *QVEU* is excited to welcome Dr. Adam Catching to the lab as an IRTA Fellow! We are also joined this summer by Danny Morales, a G-SOAR intern from Florida International University studying antiviral immunity in mosquitoes. Jack Dorman, a Johns Hopkins Graduate Partnership Program student, joined the lab for his rotation working on the phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral viral protein sequences. Excited to welcome them all in the lab!
