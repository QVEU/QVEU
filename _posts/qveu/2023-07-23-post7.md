Summer has come to the QVEU and brought many changes! We said goodbye to Rebecca Walker, founding lab member of the QVEU, who is starting in Medical School at Wake Forest this Summer. We also welcomed Emily Fritsche, our SIP Summer Intern, and welcomed *back* Jack Dorman, who will be pursuing his Ph.D. in the lab. The lab traveled to ASV (and William to a GRC), where we presented our work and got to know our LVD colleagues a bit better (see above)!
