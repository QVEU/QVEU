  abstract = "More information, including a guide to LabScrum, can be found at
              labscrum.org There are many challenges in the work of academic
              research labs, such as a lack of established process for
              planning, competing commitments requiring frequent task
              switching, and long delays in decisions. Silos of information
              create opacity of knowledge, and the individual nature of much of
              the work can create isolation that is demotivating. We were
              curious to see if an Agile-based project management approach
              could provide value in the face of these challenges. The Scrum
              framework seemed like a good place to start -- lightweight, yet
              with more frequent and shorter feedback loops than before. As an
              experiment, we implemented Scrum with one lab in the Center for
              Translational Neuroscience at the University of Oregon. We
              continue to adapt and evolve as the implementation spreads to
              other labs and we work with an ever growing number of scientists.
              The adaption from Scrum to LabScrum took a great deal of
              consideration and experimentation given significant differences
              in goals, constraints, and environment between industry and
              academia. We named our adaptation LabScrum to reflect the
              customization for the academic research lab context. Using
              LabScrum, lab personnel are seeing increased productivity and
              increased visibility of short, medium, and long term planning and
              goals. Personnel are also benefiting from improved graduate
              student training, increased information sharing/collaboration,
              and improved social support and positive lab culture.",
