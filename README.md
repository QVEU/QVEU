The **Quantitative Virology and Evoluton Unit** is led by [Patrick Dolan, Ph.D.](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/patrick-t-dolan-phd), Stadtman Investigator and Unit Chief in the [Laboratory of Viral Diseases](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/lab-viral-diseases), NIH-NIAID, in Bethesda, MD. 

Our work is focused on the use of quantitative approaches to understand the roles of heterogeneity, history, and constraint on viral emergence and evolution. In one focus area, we use single-cell sequencing approaches to characterize the responses to infection in cell culture and animal models. We hope to these studies will help us understand within-host evolutionary dynamics, and the determinants of host tropism and pathogenesis. On the other arm, we use phylogenetic tools to reconstruct the evolution of emerging viruses, and experimentally interrogate these ancestral evolutionary paths with mutational screens to understand how viruses emerge. 

Those interested in joining the lab should contact [Patrick Dolan, Ph.D.](mailto:Patrick.Dolan@nih.gov).
