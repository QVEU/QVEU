"William Bakhache earned his Ph.D. in 2020 at the Institute of Research in Infectiology of Montpellier (IRIM) in France under the supervision of Laurence Briant. During his Ph.D., William investigated Chikungyuna virus (CHIKV) replication machinery on a fundamental level studying the functional interactions between CHIKV replication protein nsP1 and host cell membranes. Then during the COVID-19 pandemic, he put his experience in (+)RNA viruses toward identifying novel antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 and studying their mechanism of action. In November 2021, William began his postdoctoral fellowship at the Quantitative Virology and Evolution Unit (QVEU) at NIH-NIAID in Bethesda, MD under the supervision of Patrick Dolan, Ph.D. where he will aim to delve into the molecular mechanisms governing (+) RNA virus evolution."
