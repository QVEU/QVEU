"William Bakhache earned his Ph.D. in 2020 at the Institute of Research in Infectiology of Montpellier (IRIM) in France under the supervision of Laurence Briant. During his Ph.D., William investigated Chikungyuna virus (CHIKV) replication machinery on a fundamental level where he studied the functional interactions between CHIKV replication protein nsP1 and host cell membranes. Then during the COVID-19 pandemic, he put his experience on (+)RNA viruses to identify novel antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 and to study their mechanism of action. In November 2021, William began his postdoctoral fellowship at the Quantitative Virology and Evolution Unit (QVEU) at NIH-NIAID in Bethesda, MD led by Patrick Dolan where he will aim to delve into the molecular mechanisms governing (+) RNA virus evolution."
