Patrick T. Dolan, Ph.D. is an experimental virologist and computational biologist whose work focuses on the evolution of positive-sense RNA viruses. Patrick earned his B.S. degree in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics from Michigan State University, where he worked in the laboratory of Prof. Yong-Hui Zheng on the antiviral function of APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases in HIV-1. Patrick earned his Ph.D. in Biological Sciences in 2014 from Purdue University, where he studied the form and function of the hepatitis C virus-host protein interaction network under the supervision of Prof. Douglas J. LaCount and co-advisor Prof. Michael Gribskov. He then pursued postdoctoral studies at Stanford University and University of California, San Francisco, in the laboratories of Profs. Raul Andino and Judith Frydman where he developed methods to understand the evolutionary dynamics of enteroviruses and flaviviruses in alternative host environments. In the fall of 2021, Patrick will begin as Unit Chief of the Quantitative Virology and Evolution Unit (QVEU) at NIH-NIAID in Bethesda, MD where his lab will continue to study the forces that shape the long- and short-term evolution of RNA virus populations.
