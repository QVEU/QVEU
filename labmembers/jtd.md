"Jack Dorman is a PhD student in the Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology & Biophysics program of the NIH-JHU Graduate Partnership. He did his undergrad at Purdue University in Microbiology and Cell, Molecular & Developmental Biology. There he worked in the lab of Dr. Giovanna Carpi on several projects beginning with a collaboration with Microsoft Research's Project Premonition. Later he worked on Oxford Nanopore Sequencing of the microbiome of Anopheles funestus and optimization of high-throughput DNA extraction methods on Anopheles specimens. During the COVID-19 pandemic he worked on genomics surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 on Purdue's campus using ONT platforms. Towards the end of his undergraduate career he worked in the lab of Dr. Richard Kuhn on Hepatitis C virus vaccine candidate platforms. His long term interests are in reconstructing flavivirus evolution and exploring how they navigate the dual constraints of vertebrate and invertebrate hosts."
