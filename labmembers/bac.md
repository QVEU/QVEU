"Adam Catching earned his Ph.D. in Biophysics from the University of California, San Francisco in the lab of Raul Andino. Adam focused on the structural, biophysical, and population genetics of Enteroviruses, particulary Enterovirus A71, Enterovirus D68, and Poliovirus. A brief respite was taken from this research during the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic to study and join lab efforts to better understand respiratory virus transmission from a modeling and clinical sample perspective. Prior to graduate work at UCSF, Adam worked in the lab of Rob Phillips at Caltech, studying the composition and dynamics of bacteriophage populations in the human oral microbiome. Adam received a B.S. in Physics from California State University, Chico in 2016. Adam joined the QVEU in June 2022, where he will continue studies in enterovirus and flavivirus adaptation dynamics and structural implications of viral adaptation."
