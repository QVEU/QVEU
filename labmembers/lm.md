"Lauren McCormick is an NIH Oxford-Cambridge Scholar in the lab, splitting her time between the QVEU and Aris Katzourakis' Lab at University of Oxford. She graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2021 with a B.S. in Biology and minors in Medical Anthropology and Statistics & Analytics. During her first year at UNC-Chapel Hill, Lauren joined the Infectious Disease Epidemiology & Ecology Lab (IDEEL) at the UNC Institute of Global Health and Infectious Diseases, where she was mentored by Dr. Steven Meshnick, Dr. Jonathan Parr, and Dr. Jonathan Juliano. Over the course of her time with IDEEL, Lauren worked on several studies aimed at understanding the molecular epidemiology of malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa. Her work culminated in an honors thesis investigating the prevalence of anti-malarial drug resistance in Dschang, Cameroon. After graduating, Lauren joined the Human Immunology Section of the Vaccine Research Center (VRC/NIAID/NIH) as a post-baccalaureate fellow under Dr. Daniel Douek. Now, as an NIH Oxford-Cambridge Scholar, Lauren is hoping to combine phylogenetic inference techniques and phylodynamic modeling with laboratory experiments to advance our understanding of how viruses evolve. She is particularly interested in interrogating the factors that influence and constrain the evolution of enterovirus proteins."
