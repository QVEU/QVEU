"Nathânia Dábilla earned her Ph.D. in 2021 at the Institute of Tropical Pathology and Public Health (IPTSP) of Federal University of Goias (UFG) in Brazil with an internship at the National Institutes of Health (NIH, Bethesda, MD) in the Calicivirus section (NIAID/NIH). During her Ph.D., she worked with samples obtained from young children and immunocompromised individuals to evaluate diversity and evolution within and among hosts of Norovirus under the supervision and co-supervision of Prof. Menira Souza (IPTSP/UFG) and Dr. Kim Green (CV/NIAID/NIH), respectively. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she improved her experience in Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics in a multi-center collaboration to perform the evolutionary and epidemiological track of the SARS-CoV-2 variants in Goias/Brazil under the supervision of Prof. Menira Souza and Prof. Fabiola Fiaccadori (IPTSP/UFG). In January of 2021, Nathânia began her postdoctoral fellowship at the Quantitative Virology and Evolution Unit (QVEU) at NIAID-NIH in Bethesda, MD under the supervision of Patrick Dolan, Ph.D. where she will focus on the study of the within-host evolution and pathogenesis of enteroviruses and other RNA viruses."
