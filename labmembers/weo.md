"Walker joined the Dolan Lab winter 2023, just in time to see the cherry blossoms in DC. He got interested in science by way of breadmaking and has been behind the bench in plant biology labs, bakeries, and community woodshops alike. He's excited to help William and Adam with their projects while he works to develop his own projects and further his skills."
