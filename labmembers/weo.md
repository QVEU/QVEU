Walker joined the Dolan Lab winter 2023, just in time to see the cherry blossoms in DC. Before coming to the East Coast, he studied molecular evolution in the charismatic _Mimulus_ monkeyflower under Dr. Arielle Cooley at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington. He will begin a PhD program in the Biological Sciences department at the University of Maryland, College Park this fall.

He has wide-ranging interests in molecular virology, virus evolution, and viral immunology, including:
<ul>
  <li>How mutations tune the properties of viral capsids for different environments</li>
  <li>Using mutational scanning to explore mechanistic questions in humoral immunity development</li>
  <li>How viral capsids maintain cell attachment while evading neutralizing antibodies</li>
  <li>Using sequencing-based approaches to generate antigenic maps</li>
  <li>Vaccine development for non-polio enteroviruses</li>
</ul>

Currently, he's developing pilot projects using insertion-based tools in Enterovirus A71.

Outside of work, he enjoys craft projects of all manner.
