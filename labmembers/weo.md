Walker joined the Dolan Lab winter 2023, just in time to see the cherry blossoms in DC. Before coming to the East Coast, he studied molecular evolution in the charismatic _Mimulus_ monkeyflower under Dr. Arielle Cooley at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington.

He is interested in molecular evolution and synthetic biology from two angles; first, how can bioengineers use evolution as a creative tool; and second, how can biotechnologists enable evolutionary experimentation in systems that were previously resistant to these approaches? 

His current project focuses on using Deep Mutational Scanning in Enterovirus A-71 both to gain insight into constraints on the evolution of its proteins and to generate tools, like epitope-tagged and fluorescently-labeled viruses, that will be useful to others in the field.

Outside of work, he enjoys craft projects of all manner.
