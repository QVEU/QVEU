Elysse earned a Ph.D. in 2025 from the Microbiology and Immunology Department at the Stanford University School of Medicine. During their Ph.D., Elysse characterized novel circular RNA molecules expressed by SARS-CoV-2 and investigated their contributions to pathogenesis under the co-mentorship of Dr. Peter Sarnow and Dr. David Schneider. In September of 2025, Elysse began their postdoctoral fellowship at the Quantitative Virology and Evolution Unit (QVEU) at NIAID-NIH in Bethesda, MD under the supervision of Patrick Dolan, Ph.D. where they will study viral evolution and pathogenesis of RNA viruses.
