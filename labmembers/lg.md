"Leonardo Giordano is a current post-baccalaureate at the National Institute of Health. He completed his undergraduate studies at Florida International University (FIU) with a Bachelor of Science in Biology, minoring in Computer Science. There he worked in the lab of Dr. Jessica Siltberg-Liberles on several projects. Later, he worked on analyzing SARS-CoV-2 mutations and proposing broadly neutralizing antiviral and vaccine targets. At the end of his undergraduate career, he worked with Dr. Jaime Mayoral on a Design to Data lab, where he advanced protein modeling software's predictive capabilities by characterizing single amino acid mutants. He conducted primary research on a self-designed protein mutant, contributing to a nationwide collaborator database.
Currently at NIH, he is evaluating the impact of climate change on dengue virus evolution. His work involves programming the Opentrons OT-2 robot to optimize experimental protocols, automating laboratory procedures, and conducting experiments to study evolutionary adaptations of the dengue virus under varying climate conditions. He collaborates with interdisciplinary teams to integrate findings into broader research initiatives."
