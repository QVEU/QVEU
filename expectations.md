Expectations Document - Quantitative Virology and Evolution Unit  2021

Preface

The purpose of this document is to layout expectations and provide general information for members of the Quantitative Virology and Evolution Unit (QVEU). This is a living document that will change as the lab changes. 

Please read it thoroughly, and if anything in this document seems incorrect, outdated or , please bring it up to Patrick or the group. Even though this is not a permanent document it is important that we all agree to follow the expectations as defined here and respect the process as it’s set forth. 

Welcome 

Welcome to the Quantitative Virology and Evolution Unit, the Dolan Lab. I am incredibly honored and excited that you’ve chosen to continue your training here. I look forward to supporting your development as an independent scientist, and look forward to learning with and from you during your time in the lab. 

My responsibilities to you. 

I am here to support your scientific training and . Here at the NIH, PI’s have a different role than in most academic institutions. Instead of writing grants, I can focus time on actively participating in the research; through my own experiments and by assisting and guiding the projects in the lab more directly.

The Mission

The mission of the QVEU is to untangle concepts of viral evolution, emergence, and pathogenesis through rigorous quantitative experiments and computational biology. 

The three concepts I want to motivate the lab are:
- Heterogeneity - how does diversity and selection in viral and host cell populations affect the outcome of infection and evolution?
- Constraint - what are the forces (biological, genetic, or biophysical) that shape evolutionary processes?
- History - how can historical data (either measured or inferred computationally) be used to enhance our understanding of viral diversification and emergence?

Motivating Values

Core values are the beliefs that motivate us. In my scientific training, I’ve found my two core values are Curiosity and Responsibility. To me, scientific curiosity is the fuel that runs this machine. Without it, we have no new questions and can easily find ourselves just “punching the clock” and doing the same experiments on the same variables we always have. When things aren’t working, it is my own curiosity that will keep me asking new questions and spurring me on through the difficult times. Responsibility is what makes us do the rest of the job - the paperwork, cleaning, organization, and participation - when we might rather not. I encourage you to think about your own core values and how they motivate you and shape your interactions. My core values shape this document, but I want to understand how your core values motivate you. 


Computational Concets
The science we do is only possible with computation to back it up, so scientists in the lab will be pushed to learn both the experimental and computational concepts that are used in our work. 


Safety

As virologists the work we do has some inherent risks. It is critical that we all exercise key safety 

Situational awareness is the key to safety. Everyone is expected to exercise situational awareness.
	Perception - of the elements in the environment
	Comprehension - of the situation
	Projection - of future status

Safety in a Microbiological Laboratory (Adapted from CDC guidance):
1. Hygiene:
	Wash in and out of the lab and between tasks.
	Do not eat or drink in lab.
	Isolate your lab surfaces from your computers and personal devices. 
	
2. Equipment:	
	Do you have the necessary equipment and PPE to do the experiment safely? 
	Think about this far ahead of time so we can get what you need.
	Appropriate equipment for the job.
	Reduce risk where possible.
	Minimize splashing and aerosolization. 
	Secondary containment when necessary. 

3. Decontamination:
	Clean work surfaces.
	Place all contaminated items in leak-proof containers. 
	Use secondary containment when transporting infectious materials (e.g. a locked, plastic container to hold your tube rack).
	Regular decontamination is critical to high quality work and we will keep a tidy, regularly decontaminated work area (regularly 10% bleach and 60% Ethanol). 
	Be aware of what come into the work area and what goes out.

4. Signs and Labels:
	Make sure you are working in designated areas appropriately.
	Make sure your work area and reagents, and waste are appropriately labeled.
	 
5. Training:
	Are you properly trained to use a piece of equipment? 
	Have you done adequate preparation (i.e. reading), planning, and visualization to foresee potential risks? 
	
If you do not know the appropriate hygiene, equipment, decontamination or labeling necessary for a given task, you still require some training. That’s OK, just ask!

Ethics

Robust results rely on honest and rigorous science. No dishonesty will be tolerated.




Core competencies of for :
￼

As a post-doc your main goal should be to develop an independent research program within the framework fo the lab. Depending on your ultimate career plans, your goals in the lab will be different but some basic tools will be required. 

What hiring managers/committees are looking for:
- Industry: Specific technical expertise and experience. 
- Academia: High-quality publications, compelling research questions. 
- Government: ?


This Lab Manual is designed to make your transition into the Sherlock Lab as smooth and painless as possible. It is also intended as a general guide that answers frequently asked questions and sets out the lab culture and expectations. If anything does not make sense, please do not hesitate to talk with either the lab manager or Gavin. 

As you know, I (Gavin Sherlock) am the PI of the lab. I am responsible for helping you all to maintain a lab environment that encourages personal and professional growth; I am also fully committed to ensuring that the lab is a happy and fun place to be, especially since science can be hard! I am especially conscious of the interpersonal dynamics of the lab and I place a high priority on keeping our work environment friendly, honest, open, and safe. Maintaining these principles is every lab member’s responsibility and I appreciate your help in contributing to the positive environment of the group. Entering a prestigious University lab can be intimidating, and I know that you likely have high expectations of yourself and what you will accomplish while you are here. Keep in mind that we are all working towards a common goal and can benefit from one another’s expertise and insights; the lab culture reflects this collective spirit. We are all responsible for ensuring that being a graduate of the Sherlock lab communicates a sense of scientific excellence, personal integrity and generosity.
￼
Our Research

Communication and Documentation  

Our lab operates as paperless as possible. Therefore many of the tools you will you need can be found in the shared lab drive, or on other electronic lab resources such as benching. 
 
Shared Drive 

Our Google Drive acts as a huge pool of resources and data storage for the lab. Ideally, lab members will post all standard operating procedures, collaborative research documents, documents that need editing, directions for ordering, lab procedures, grant documents, meeting schedules, pictures from lab social events, and more. If you are unsure how to do something, whether it be placing an order or doing wet lab work, the Drive should be the first place you check for help.

When you receive your government computer you will also be given access to your personal and shared drives for storing research data. 



Slack

The lab slack channel can be found at: QVEU.slack.com
Request access using 

https://join.slack.com/t/qveu/shared_invite/zt-sspu46d0-mJUV8OjwjOoJTaFyPKGlZg

Slack is the preferred method for communication in the lab. It’s incredibly useful for sharing data and papers, sending calendar reminders. When you are added to the lab slack, you will be automatically added to general channels: #general, #lab-#science-literature, #lab-organization, 

If you need to be added to Slack, please ask Gavin to add you.

NOTE: All communication are monitored. Please keep this in mind when using any laboratory or government equipment. 

Lab Mailing List
IN addition to slack, which should be the most reliable method of communicating, the lab e-mail list is: [INSERT LAB MAILING LIST] for members of the lab. Patrick will add you. 

Google Shared Calendar

Our lab calendar is the official word on meetings, lectures, presentations. You should also put any planned vacations or extended work-from-home time, so that others can be aware if you receive packages or are relying on you for collaborations. 
We will also develop specific calendars for equipment using google calendar. 
Computational Resources/Storage

As a computational and systems biology lab, we are users and stewards of data. Our goal is to maintain the integrity, usability, and reproducibility of the data we generate. 

1. Use GitHub for version control. Our lab uses GitHub for version control and software documentation. We have a github repository for the lab at: https://github.com/QVEU

To create an account: https://github.com/join

The lab website is also currently hosted on GitHub: 


2. Use a standard pipeline whenever possible. If we have a developed workflow for a common tasks, re-use that workflow - there should be a very high bar to using something different, or writing something new to solve a problem we think is already solved. To aid in standardization of results and comparison between experiments, use one of these workflows when possible for your experiment. If the workflow doesn’t do what you need, consider talking to the author (if they are still here) about incorporating a new module. Better yet, write what you need, test it, and submit a pull request.  
3. Publish code that is well-documented, tested, easy to install and maintained. If you publish a software tool, it is expected to be open source, installable with Conda and maintained for at least two years after publication. At minimum, the package should include a test dataset and expected output.  
4. Use the SCG cluster for data storage and computation. More thorough instructions live at the SCG Tools repo.  
5. Ask questions on the #computing Slack channel. Someone has probably had the same error as you, perhaps many times. If you can’t figure it out after a good faith effort (often googling an error message will lead you to an answer), reach out to others on Slack or in person. If there’s a problem with a workflow, you could also submit an issue on GitHub. 

Lab Matters

Onboarding Tasks
Onboarding with the Sherlock Lab involves completing several training courses through Stanford’s STARS system (via Axess) and with CITI Program. For a list of required trainings, see the lab manager. This is because we occasionally work with minors, including undergraduate and high school students. As such, we are mandated reporters and must complete the necessary training.

Personal Behavior
The Sherlock Lab and Stanford University are wholly committed to maintaining a professional and supportive community. Professionalism encompasses respect for colleagues in every department at every rank, visitors, and vendors; it means maintaining the highest standards of integrity, working hard, and being proud of your work; professionals are reliable, honest, and present themselves in a competent and confident manner. Support entails academically challenging and bettering each other via constructive criticism, teaching, and collaboration; being fully inclusive, regardless of gender, race, nationality, etc.; supportive lab members will place importance on the success of their colleagues, lab, and University. Please keep in mind that you represent Stanford University and the Sherlock lab, and your behavior within and outside of the University is a reflection on us all.

Within the Sherlock Lab we have our own certain expectations of individual behavior. Space is shared, and working (often more than) forty hours a week in one room with the same people can be stressful. The goal of having a peaceful and comfortable lab hinges on members acting with maturity and discretion. Respect your colleagues’ space, belongings, lifestyles, and opinions. While stimulating academic debates are encouraged, arguing is not, and serious or repeated offences will be brought to Gavin’s attention. That being said, we are all adults and personal and interpersonal issues should be solved by those involved whenever possible.

NOTE: Humor can be in bad taste. Videos/jokes/sayings/stereotyping etc. that involve potentially hurtful material should not be shared in the workplace (or preferably anywhere), and will not be tolerated. Please be conscientious of who is around you and what impression you may be making.

Finding a Project

Two brains are better than one, especially when creativity is the task. My hope is that everyone will engage in a period of intense and collaborative thinking when they join the lab, and periodically thereafter, to conceive of a project that is:

* original 
* important 
* interesting 
* complements other projects in the lab 
* meshes with the overall direction of the group and its funding base 

When developing an idea for a project, focus on the biological question, and think about what is the best possible outcome you can imagine for the project, and what would it mean, and how important it would be. If the best possible outcome you can think of isn’t that exciting, or won’t move the field forward (or define a new field!), then the project idea still needs refinement.

I will help shape the project to meet these goals but expect that each person in the lab provides the creative spark behind their respective projects. Once a project is underway, feedback should be continually sought out and provided. Your greatest resource is access to and the input from your colleagues.

Individual Expectations

Everyone

* Work hours: There are no enforced working hours, but productivity is expected. Work schedules can vary, however, in order to benefit from the other scientists in the lab it is important that you work in the lab. Attendance at lab stand-up meetings and biweekly review are expected. If any lab meeting or event needs to be rescheduled because of a recurring conflict, please let me know.  
* Working remotely: 
* Lab absences: 
* Vacation: 
* Dress code: 
* Food/drink: 
* Professionalism: 
* Lab maintenance: 
* Being a good lab citizen:
* 
* Be a good steward of our funds: Remember that we are funded by the taxpayer (you) Doing the research we do is a great privilege and something that we should all consider when we think about how we spend/use resources.  
* Closed-loop communication: 

Graduate Students
* Work towards your dissertation. TA positions and non-required courses are important and valuable opportunities, but in the end your research is what gets you the degree. 
* Help mentor undergraduate and new graduate students. This may include mentoring a rotation student for a quarter. Note that if you are mentoring someone, your time in lab should be during more “regular” hours (ie. 9am - 5pm). 
* Develop your research skills from wet lab, to computation and analysis, to asking the right questions and using best practice.  
* Present at lab meetings. This will be required regardless of where you are in your project (just starting, troubleshooting, collecting data, writing a paper, etc.).  
* Expand your network. Attend conferences, seminars, events, etc. to connect with as many professionals in (and outside) your field as possible.  
* Graduate in no more than six years, and ideally in about five. Engage Gavin and postdocs/fellows in your career options - they are a great source of advice and a huge networking resource. 

Postdocs and Fellows
* Help mentor undergraduate and graduate students. As the most senior researchers in the lab, your expertise is invaluable to the younger/less experienced lab members. You may be assigned (or request) a rotation or undergrad student. Note that if you are mentoring someone, your time in lab should be during more “regular” hours (ie. 9am - 5pm). 
* Don’t limit yourself to your past experiences. You are here to learn and mature as a scientist. Speak with Gavin about techniques you’d like to learn or refine. 
* Expand your network. Attend conferences, seminars, events, etc. to connect with as many professionals in (and outside) your field as possible.  
* Present at lab meetings. This will be required regardless of where you are in your project (just starting, troubleshooting, collecting data, writing a paper, etc.).  
* Your time in the Sherlock Lab will be variable, but typically between 2-5 years. Actively engage Gavin in your post-Sherlock Lab plans. Not only does he (try to) offer insightful advice, but he is a huge networking resource. 

Rotation Students
* Work with Gavin and your rotation mentor to develop your rotation project while keeping your more limited time in the lab in mind. You will likely be contributing to a larger project in the lab, though sometimes, rotation students do start entirely new lines of investigation (of course, this requires more time/effort!).  
* Plan on spending 6 - 8 hours in the lab per day (subject to course schedules and other meetings/events). The hours spent in lab will ideally be during typical work hours (ie. between 9am - 5pm) so that you have access to your labmates and especially your mentor.  
* You will be expected to give a lab meeting presentation at the end of your rotation.  
* Participate in first year activities and courses. Getting to know your classmates, the faculty, and Stanford should be a priority. 
* Challenge yourself - you are here to learn! Talk to your graduate student mentor or Gavin about computational or wet lab techniques you would like to learn or refine. Do contribute skills you may have from past experiences, but don’t limit yourself to your comfort zone. 
* Get to know all the lab members - after all, you’re here to feel out how spending four more years in this lab might be. Talk about their experiences in the lab and at Stanford, ask about their future plans and how graduate school may have shaped them, see what advice they have to offer. 
* Make connections within the lab and across campus (or the country...or the world) using other lab members’ networks. Even if you don’t end up with us next year, you may find the Sherlock Lab is a great resource for your future projects. 
* Each quarter, we will put on a rotation student bootcamp taught by older members of the lab. This will cover the basics of our research and computational work. The material will be tailored to what interests you, so let us know if there’s anything in particular you’d like to focus on at the start of your rotation.  

Undergraduate Students
* The Sherlock Lab prefers long-term commitment from undergraduate interns, which ideally includes a summer of working in the lab full time. You are expected to be in the lab as long and as often as it takes to fulfill your lab obligations, which is typically around six to ten hours per week. Undergraduates should also attend lab meetings whenever possible. 
* Assist graduate students and postdocs with research/data collection. You will be primarily assigned to one lab member and they will be responsible for keeping you busy. However, if there is something specific you would like to learn or practice, please let your mentor or Gavin know. We are invested in your development as a scientist. 
* Present your research at lab meeting, typically once per year at the end of the school year. 
* Do not overwhelm yourself. At this point in your scientific career getting your degree is your priority. Make sure you are attending and engaging in your courses, and enjoying your undergraduate time at Stanford! 
* Learn! You are surrounded by a group of very talented researchers and should take full advantage. Ask questions, explore the various career paths of the scientists around you, push yourself. 

Lab Manager
* Help mentor undergraduate, new graduate, and rotation students.  
* Assist with the onboarding of new lab members by providing the necessary documents and training info. 
* Assist with graduate student and postdoc research/data collection when time permits and if help is needed. 
* Develop your own independent research direction. You are also here to develop your research skills! Work with Gavin to create a research project that will still allow you to perform your management duties. 
* Present your research at lab meeting typically 1-2 times per year. 
* Be in the lab at typical workday times and maintain a fairly regular schedule. The lab manager is an essential resource for everyone in the lab and should be as accessible as possible. 
* Place orders and monitor financial activity in close collaboration with Holly. Be the liaison between vendors and lab members and stay on top of organization - after all you will have to solve any billing/ordering/delivery issues that arise! 
* Monitor the lab’s email and phone and take responsibility for the physical lab itself - meaning it is your responsibility to submit work orders for moving/disposing of equipment, requesting repairs, etc. 
* Remember: You do not manage the people, you manage the environment. You are responsible for overseeing the general goings on in the lab and making sure that everyone has the tools they need to succeed. 

PI
As the PI of the lab and a mentor, I (Gavin) will:
* Mentor graduate, undergraduate, rotation, and medical students, postdocs, fellows, and staff. 
* Treat each lab member equally and with respect. 
* Respect your time. If I can’t make a meeting I will let you know as soon as possible so we can reschedule. If you send me a document to edit I will try to return it to you in a timely manner. If you feel like I’ve forgotten, send me a Slack message or email reminder. I never want to be the “slow step” in manuscript submission or other tasks. 
* Provide timely, constructive, and honest feedback to your research ideas, methods, papers, etc. 
* Meet with individuals weekly/biweekly and attend all lab meetings, and be as available as possible via Slack and email for consultation. If you need more time/more immediate help, come by my office. If the door is open come on in to chat. If it is closed, please knock to see if I’m available. 
* Give you credit for your work, especially in public presentations. 
* Respect your goals and what you hope to get out of this program, and provide you with the scientific and professional guidance to help you achieve those goals.  
* Be a lifelong mentor to whatever extent that you choose to engage me in that role. I truly care to keep in touch with you all and hear about the paths you have taken post-Stanford. 
* I will work hard to ensure that our lab’s reputation remains positive and that our work positively impacts the quest for knowledge that we are all a part of.  
* I will endeavor to ensure that our work remains well funded, and will teach you how to be a good steward of the funds that we are fortunate to receive from the taxpayer (government).  

Notebooks

Research methods and data are expected to be meticulously and faithfully recorded. Each lab member should keep a notebook or binder. Your research is meant to move the entire field of genetics forward, which is impossible without reproducible and replicable procedures/results. Fabrication and/or falsification of results and plagiarism are wholly unacceptable and will not only affect your reputation but those of collaborators, the PI, the department, and the University. Concerns of academic misconduct should be brought to Gavin’s attention immediately. 

Past members’ notebooks are a crucial resource. I am required by NIH rules to keep these for several years and they must be usable for verifying data in any publication, should questions arise. You are welcome to make copies of your own notebooks to take with you when you leave but the original must remain here.

My general guidelines are:

1. Use a separate notebook for each project. 
2. Date every experiment. 
3. Indicate the overall purpose of the experiment. 
4. Record full details of materials and methods.  
5. Include “back of the envelope” calculations (i.e., don’t use the back of an envelope, paper towel, etc.) so that these can be checked if there is a problem (ranging from how you made a 10 mM stock of some reagent to how you made a reaction mix). 
6. Present the key results and/or refer to any electronic database with the results. Include all original data (e.g., gel photos, FACS plots, etc.). 
7. Describe your conclusions – write this for your, my and future lab-workers’ benefit. Talk to us! State lessons learned, even if negative. Put models in to help you and others think about the work. It is also helpful to note which experiment/figures are in your papers and provide clear descriptions of how reagents such as strains, plasmids etc. were made, and which reagents were used for your published research. 

I recommend that you use a three-ring binder so that you can include data in various forms. I like to use one side of the paper for the formal notes and one for the rough notes/calculations/etc.. Use a three-hole transparent holder for things that can’t easily be punched.

Some people have begun to use electronic notebooks – I agree these can have certainly advantages, such as being searchable and indexable, but if you do this, please make sure that the notebook application allows you to share the entire notebook file, preferably as a pdf, as well as the original document format.

Shared Reagents.
We cannot afford for everyone to have his/her own tube of everything. Additionally, if everyone removes an aliquot that is, likely, more than actually needed (“just in case”) then we will end up with lots of small tubes with small amounts that end up wasting materials. So, with very rare exceptions, please do not set up your own stash of samples of common reagents.

Maintaining stocks of shared reagents requires everyone to order a replacement WELL BEFORE the stock is gone, typically when the penultimate tube/bottle is nearly finished. If you are unsure what to do, please ask. It can be very frustrating to start an experiment only to find that someone else used up all of a reagent that you need, without reordering. On the flip side, when you are planning an experiment, check that you have everything you need before you begin (preferably the day before), and if you are going to use a large amount of some reagent, order replacements in advance.

Unique Reagents.

Please store all unique reagents in a box that is clearly marked with your name.
Please date everything as YYMMDD format. This is enormously helpful in figuring out the value of what’s in a tube, be it a purchased reagent or a home-grown one (it allows us to look up in your notebook more about it, differentiate between different versions of something and, in some instances, figure out who the tube might belong to).

Please place your name or initials on every tube of truly important/unique reagents (like plasmids, etc.) and every item placed in common space so that these don’t become ‘zombies’ taking up needed space. We spend a lot of time trying to figure out who owns a given tube and I’m worried about throwing something precious out when a nameless tube shows up somewhere. This also lets people know who to find if items are spilled, broken, etc. Obviously, this is not necessary for aliquoted tubes of ROUTINE reagents that are in YOUR box.

Please confer with Katja about strains, and when strains need to enter the GSY collection.

Talks.

Throughout your time at Stanford you will be expected to present your research many times in multiple formats. Being able to efficiently present your data in an enjoyable way will be incredibly helpful to your career as a scientist. There is always room for improvement and every chance you get to refine these skills should be seen as an opportunity for growth.

Unless you have given essentially the same talk before, please plan to practice with whomever from the group can come. Likewise, please try to make time to attend someone else’s practice talk and give input. When listening to someone else’s presentation (whether it’s lab meeting or a practice talk), please be respectful in your criticism, and don’t hold them to a higher standard than you hold yourself. Likewise, do take on board people’s constructive criticisms to help improve your presentations. Since most of us don’t like to be hypocritical, it is useful to criticize and then apply those criticisms of others to your own talks. I also recommend inviting someone from outside the lab to the talk to catch the omission of things that we all take as “given” but others don’t (e.g., use of lab-specific jargon, system-specific “insider” knowledge, etc.). Make sure you time yourself multiple times while speaking out loud to be conscientious of time constraints. If you’re giving a seminar (rather than a short talk at a conference) let your audience know up front if it’s ok to ask questions during your talk. I personally enjoy being asked questions when I give talks, but different people have different styles, and preferring questions only at the end is also ok.

I have truly never been anything other than proud to listen to a presentation from someone in the lab. That doesn’t mean we can’t all improve our presentation skills and I will provide feedback for both the practice talk and the actual talk. I will try to apply the FAST feedback principle (Frequent, Accurate, Specific and Timely).
Please provide me with an electronic copy of your talk in the Dropbox folder I have set up for you – if you don’t have one, please ask me to set it up; these are invaluable summations of your work and a nice complement to the more detailed lab meeting presentations. Please name such files with the date of the presentation, and the venue it was presented.

Posters
LESS IS MORE. Many people, myself included, find posters hard to take in because the space for poster sessions is often dimly lit, extremely crowded and noisy and full of distractions. As a result, they should not be a paper that you reformat to a poster, with tons of words and details. Instead, they should be very light, generally with text in bullet format and with relatively few words, and large, clear figures. People passing by need to see a short summary to decide if this is something that they want to take the time to look at in detail. Conclusions are also essential. 
I like to review posters to help provide input and to be sure that I know what we are saying/showing publicly.

Please put final copies of all posters in your Dropbox folder for archiving.

Lab members typically order posters from BioTech Productions (http://www.biotech-productions.com/). Our contact there is named Vince and he is very helpful. They have good prices and offer same day delivery.

Writing a Paper

The process of writing a paper should be started as early as possible. It involves preparing/evaluating the data that will be included, being thoughtful and thorough about authorship structure, carrying out a comprehensive review of prior literature on your topic, and identifying potential areas for improvement in the actual experiments that were performed (repeating experiments, carrying out additional controls, identifying potential confounders). There are many “individualized” aspects of preparing a manuscript - below, I outline two major aspects of manuscript writing - authorship and the general writing “process”. 

Authorship: Authorship should and will be discussed “early and often”. It is important to realize that being an author on a manuscript is an honor, but it also carries substantial responsibility. Many fantastic scientific discoveries would not have been possible without collaborative partnership in research and the joint authorship that goes along with this. In most cases, working on a scientific team is a rewarding and meaningful growth experience - but as with all growth experiences, sometimes there can be some “growing pains”. Sometimes, authorship decisions are easy - on occasion, there can be disagreements on the importance and weighting of different contributions to a manuscript. Gavin and the primary/lead author will be responsible for keeping track of contributions. It can be easy to forget the contributions of people who came early in the experimental process - so it is critical that the lead author start and maintain a document that is a running list of all contributors/contributions. As a guideline, we will follow the principles laid out by Harvard Medical School’s Authorship guidelines. As an overarching principle, this excerpt of the guidelines nicely captures my perspective on authorship:  

“Authorship is an explicit way of assigning responsibility and giving credit for intellectual work. The two are linked. Authorship practices should be judged by how honestly they reflect actual contributions to the final product.” 

Though I would add a proviso to that statement - performing experiments whose results are in a paper clearly merits authorship. It is not just intellectual contributions that deserve merit.  If you are the lead author on a manuscript and you leave the lab before the work is completed, know that we will do our best to keep you in a lead or prominent authorship position - but often it will be necessary to do many additional experiments, perform revisions, and carry out new analyses that will require the substantial effort of another lab member. In this day and age, it can take from 4 to over 16 months from the time of initial submission to final publication of a piece of work - and with this comes a lot of effort on the part of the scientists involved. For example, the review process often unearths a variety of additional experiments or substantial re-writing that need to be done. If you as a lead author have left the lab and cannot do this, we will need to draft someone else into that important position of leading the work and credit them appropriately. 

Handling yourself professionally and courteously as a lead and contributing author is at the core of being a great scientist. It goes without saying that I (Gavin) will not tolerate unprofessional behavior in any way, shape or form as it relates to questions of authorship or anything else in the lab. That is not to say that disagreements won’t ever arise, or that robust discussion about such aren’t needed, but they must be professional and respectful at all times. Remember, the scientific community is small, so maintaining a positive reputation for being a good collaborator will take you far in this world. As an example, I collaborated with a postdoc in David Botstein’s lab in 2002, and he contacted me over a decade later to ask if I wanted to collaborate again, which led to a very nice follow up paper. 

Nuts and bolts of the writing experience: In general, Gavin recommends that the primary author(s) and Gavin meet to discuss the planned “story” and to identify the main pieces of supportive data. Once you have a good idea of the general story, Gavin suggests that you work on generating all of the Figures and figure legends, and determine what claims can be made with each figure, and then sketch out a general outline of the manuscript. Finally, a “we did this” paragraph - often the last paragraph of an Introduction, is a great thing to write early on, as it helps crystallize the narrative of a manuscript. 

As noted above, often, writing your paper will make you realize you’ve left out a key experiment, delaying submission and publication - this is a common experience and part of the motivation for outlining your manuscript ahead of time. As always, group feedback is key. Using a lab meeting to present the outline of your manuscript is a great way to sharpen your ideas, and asking your lab colleagues to read solid drafts of various sections for feedback is invariably helpful.

Please be sure I receive a final copy of a manuscript when submitted to the journal and all submitted revisions.

Please post a copy in your Dropbox folder that I set up, in the directory “Papers In Process.”.  Use a directory structure under that so it’s clear which paper it is!

Submitting an Abstract/Attending a Conference

Conferences are invaluable both for the information gleaned as well as contacts formed. Attendance at sessions is key and I strongly recommend taking good notes as the amount of information flowing in can be overwhelming and impossible to retain. Using the abstract book as what you take notes in works well in many cases but sometimes, an old fashioned notebook is best. Writing your notes up afterwards can help reinforce what you learned.

1. In general, I encourage every person in the lab to attend one conference per year. Please plan to discuss this with Gavin at a minimum at your yearly IDP meeting so that you and he can agree upon a good choice. This is important as Gavin will be funding a lot of your travel, and he needs to ensure that such travel fits within the budget of the lab.  
2. Let Gavin know about the conference you’d like to attend at least 4 weeks before the abstract deadline in order to obtain approval for funding. Please ensure you send an email to me so we can document my approval (important for reimbursements). 
3. Email Gavin and potential co-authors to let everyone know that you hope to submit an abstract for the conference at least 4 weeks before the abstract deadline. This is critical for our collaborative work – many institutions consider an abstract acceptance a “disclosure” of work that we are doing, and in situations where the work is highly collaborative, it is critical that we get their “okay” before submitting an abstract. 
4. Send Gavin and all co-authors a draft of your abstract at least 7 days before the abstract deadline in order to receive feedback/approval. 
5. Submit your abstract. 
6. Enjoy the conference! 
7. When you return, provide a one page summary of the three or four most interesting/exciting things you learned at the conference (to be shared with the lab) and/or present a summary of the conference at lab meeting. 

Possibly the most important aspect of conferences is meeting new people. The resulting network will enormously facilitate your research both in terms of information learned and the ease of obtaining reagents when those occasions arise, and more importantly, can facilitate your career as people get to know you as a scientist. To meet people, you may need to GET OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE!! I strongly recommend sitting at meals with people you don’t know. Do this for at least one, preferably two meals a day. Meaning, don’t just hang out with people you do know! Introduce yourself to those you sit next to and ask, “what do you work on” and be prepared to do likewise although I suggest answering with “I work on HOW or WHAT…” – pose it as a question you are answering so you don’t just say “I’m trying to knock-out…” Another good conversation-starter at meetings is asking someone “What’s the most interesting (coolest?) thing you’ve heard so far?”

Department Retreat.
The Genetics department has a three-day retreat in Monterey at the beginning of every fall quarter. You are encouraged and expected to attend, unless there are extenuating circumstances (sickness, family responsibilities, etc.). The retreat is a unique opportunity to get to know the faculty, staff, postdocs, and students of the department in a casual setting, and to hear about their research. The retreat includes volleyball games, lab bonding, dances, complimentary meals and drinks, and you get to stay at a hotel on the beach! I want you to have a great time at these retreats/seminars and meetings - but remember that these are professional events so it is important that we behave professionally. 
I expect all grad students and postdocs to attend all of the annual department retreat except in extraordinary circumstances. I feel very strongly that the whole point of being in a department is to benefit from the collective wisdom and knowledge of others and the department retreat is a key time to share that. If you think you know more than others, then share your brilliance. If you realize you don’t, then go to learn as well as help others. Undergrads and staff are welcome to go to the retreat too, and I encourage them to do so.

Department Seminars.
In addition to the annual retreat, the Genetics Department also puts on and participates in other seminars throughout the year. You are encouraged to attend these informative talks and networking opportunities - especially if a labmate is presenting. I believe that communication within a department is invaluable in making the most of the community of scientists we are a part of.  Selfishly, there is much to be learned from others, often unexpectedly. In addition, input to others is always useful. 

Current Issues in Genetics (CIG) is a speaker series put on each Friday from 4:00-5:00 pm in Alway M114 during the school year and part of the summer. After the presentation, one lab will host “Happy Hour” in the Alway courtyard. Please note that grad students (particularly first years) are expected to attend. 

Bug Club is a speaker series focussed on microbial research. The talks take place each Monday from 12:30-1:30pm in Clark Center room S361 (go through Peets to get to the room). To subscribe to the Bug Club listserve, go to: http://mailman.stanford.edu/ 

1. Click on the link in the "Subscription Site" column above for the list to which you wish to subscribe. 
2. Enter your email address (required) and name (optional) in the boxes in the "Subscribing to List_Name" area. 
3. Click subscribe 
4. The list is called: microjournalclub 
The Center for Computational, Evolutionary, and Human Genomics (CEHG) hosts some informative talks and events, many of which are relevant to our own research questions, which you can be alerted to using their mailing list: cehgcenterall@lists.stanford.edu. Email stanfordcehg@stanford.edu and include “Subscribe to CEHG” in the subject line to be added to the mailing list. 
Lab Meetings.

The Sherlock Lab conducts weekly lab meetings - currently our meeting time is on Fridays from 10:00 am - 12:00 pm. Everyone is expected to attend and arrive on time unless discussed previously with Gavin. Sometimes lab meeting doesn’t take place, because several people are out of town - we have a google sheet to track this :

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lk-xPdWbFOpSAjHMSXXYUHJBwajJgwKTjpEj_pXruR8/edit#gid=0

(Once the shared Google calendar is in place, it will be easier to follow). Our format for lab meeting may vary from time to time - for example, one member might present an in depth update on their project to the rest of the lab members, all lab members might provide a brief update on their research, we may have a group brainstorming session (for example, to generate ideas for rotation projects), or we may do a lab journal club. Presentations can be in the form of PowerPoint, chalk talk, video – whatever you prefer. When presenting, the purpose is to get feedback on your research, whether you are brainstorming new ideas or in the last steps of writing a paper for publishing. Lab members are expected to be attentive during presentations and offer thoughtful feedback.  If you feel you must bring your phone to lab meeting, please put it on vibrate, and if you have to take a call, then step out, so that it doesn’t disrupt the presenter. It goes without saying that people should not be looking at their phones during lab meeting.
	Participation. I am forever impressed by the benefit of collective thinking. Please share your thoughts with the group. I have many times seen a “stupid” idea spark another idea that sparked another that turned out to be truly key to a person’s project. Don’t be shy about sharing “stupid” ideas – they may not be so insane and will help the creative process. Likewise, please be mindful that everyone in the room deserves an equal opportunity to talk. Some are more reticent to do so and need some “space” to offer an opinion. Please don’t dominate the conversation and feel free to continue giving input after the meeting, one-on-one with the speaker. If you feel the speaker has not “heard” you, then just say, “Let’s talk about this more after.”
	Presentations. If you have a presentation, please send the final Powerpoint to me by 10 minutes beforehand, so I can take notes on them during the meeting. Also, I expect lab presentations to be:
* Professional. Obviously, they can be informal but that does not mean unprofessional. Be proud of your work. Professionalism also means no “F-bombs” or other swearing. Treat all questions as worthy of a considered response, regardless of whether you feel the questioner should know the answer.  
* Clear. Introduce the question, even if you’re sure everyone must remember it from the last meeting. Odds are they don’t and it can never hurt to remind them and you of the real point of the experiments. Remind us of any key aspects of the relevant biology that underlie your work. However, don’t go over well-known facts unless super-relevant; if you do include such material be sure to let us know why you are doing that. We may know the background information, but not your thinking, logic, or approaches that led to this project or question. Please don’t repeat large amounts of data from prior lab meetings – we want to know what’s new! You should be done with any needed review material within the first 5 minutes. 
* Rigorous. It is crucial that you be the most critical of your own data. You will never hang for understating a conclusion; you may hang (metaphorically speaking) for overstating it. The word identical is the preserve of integers! 
* Time-aware. Only you know what you hope to teach and learn from others. Be mindful of the time and don’t hesitate to say, “that’s very useful input but I’d like to continue this particular conversation off-line and now move on as I need your help with some work I’ve yet to describe, even more.” 

Meetings with Gavin
	I set aside an hour to meet with everyone either weekly or biweekly (your choice). I will try to give as much notice of any change as possible but occasionally, I learn of a meeting or seminar that I need to attend on short notice and ask your understanding. I expect the same of you and will likewise understand if things unavoidably change. Sometimes I am coming from the other side of campus and will be a few minutes late but will always try to call if it will be more than a few minutes. Sometimes, a meeting in my office will be on the verge of some scientific epiphany and I may ask for another few minutes when you come to my door. I promise not to abuse your gift of a few more minutes to me and one of your colleagues. If my door is shut and you’re not sure if I’m with someone, please knock – it is possible I’m working on something that needed concentration and am anxiously waiting for your arrival.
 
Biweekly written reports. Please:
1. When you are in data generation mode in the lab, send a PowerPoint update that describes your progress since our last formal meeting by the night before (or, at the latest) 8:00 a.m. in the morning on the day of our scheduled one-on-one meeting. I will use the time after breakfast to read these and actually THINK about the work. It is MUCH harder to do that when coming in cold to the conversation. 
2. Name the report – YYMMDD-xx_mtg where xx are your initials and put it in your Dropbox folder. 
3. Please use a first slide that has the date prominently displayed. I then take that slide set and merge it to the end of a slide set that has all your slides. That way, we can easily scroll up to look at data from past weeks and the date slide serves as a rough time signature.  
4. State the title and goal of each project on a separate slide. Obviously, this won’t change most weeks but it is very helpful to me and probably not bad for you, to see what you are really trying to accomplish with the work. And it “costs” nothing to have those slides repeated in the cumulative slide deck. 
5. Include any recent results in graphical format. 
6. At the end, describe short-term experimental plans that you expect to execute before our next meeting. 

If you’re not in data generation mode (e.g. you’re focused on writing a paper, or fellowship, or coding), I don’t want you to make a powerpoint for the sake of making a powerpoint. However, I do want to know what your progress is - figures made, paper sections written etc.
	
Spontaneous conversations. The scheduled meetings are only the minimum of the interaction I expect to have with you. Always feel free to stop by. If my door is open, come on in. If it’s closed then consider the bar raised in terms of how important the conversation needs to be but don’t consider this an absolute “do not disturb”; I won’t be shy about saying I’m in a meeting (in case it’s not obvious when I open the door).

Graduation (Ph.D. students only)
	I expect all Ph.D. students to graduate in about five years, or, in the worst case, no more than six years. 
	I hope that all Ph.D. students will be able and want to attend the School of Medicine graduation each June. It is a privilege for me to attend and “hood” such individuals and unless essentially impossible for me to be there, I will be! Please let me know as far in advance as possible if you will attend. I am comfortable with you “walking” through graduation before all University requirements have been met but ONLY if the thesis committee agrees that you are ready to defend your thesis AND a date for the defense has been set. 

Finishing in the lab.
Upon completion of your time in the lab, I ask the following:
* Leave lab notebooks in an organized and accessible form. That means labeling on the outside by project and indexing all notebooks with date/topic/page so that others don’t have to leaf through every page to find something. As above, you are welcome to take a copy of your notebook but the original must remain with me. Please clearly note experiments that are in your paper(s). 
* Leave a list of all reagents that might be useful to others, appropriately indexed and accessible to others. This is your “Where did they leave it” file. Please print a copy and give it to me as well as sending the electronic version. Leave very clear explanations of strains, genotypes, how they were derived, clones and their relationship to each other (same or different population?) and what were the clones used for your research and in publications. Often the name you initially call something and how you refer to it in your notebooks is different from what ends up being used in a paper. Please give us a key to “decode” that.  
* Discard all materials that could truly be of no use to others and completely clean off your bench and empty your fridge and freezer spaces (with the exception, of course, of items described in your “Where did they leave it”). 
* Consolidate important items to be kept so they take up as little space as possible. 
* Bequeath useful items (i.e. antibody stocks) to a specific person so they are not forgotten, lost and unused in a box!  
* Help me think about the direction your project should take in the future. 
* Write up any unpublished results in a timely way and take responsibility for doing such once away. 
* “Check in” periodically through life. I care about all who have ever been in the lab and hope to maintain some level of contact forever. In addition, I am required to provide current status information to funders on a periodic basis (e.g., for training grants). And, lastly, it is fun (and a challenge) to keep the “Lab Alumni/ae” on the website up to date so that you all can keep in touch with each other and prospective applicants can see what kinds of careers people take as they move on. And, for the record, I am proud of every individual’s chosen direction. Without exception. 

 

Getting Help
Being an undergraduate student, graduate student, post-doc, or Stanford staff can be difficult at times, and for many with mental health or other health needs, it can be challenging to navigate the Stanford system. Below, please find a list of resources assembled by several Stanford faculty members that may be helpful to you during your time at Stanford. These are compiled resources, and Gavin hasn’t had the opportunity to check all of them out - but hopefully this is a good starting point. We welcome additions to this list. 

Please know that Gavin is always available to discuss issues that you feel comfortable sharing with him, and he will do his best to guide you to needed help/guidance. The well being of every person in the lab is his #1 priority.

Work Orders
Work orders are submitted online and will typically be completed by the lab manager or the person needing the order. Work orders must be placed for installation of equipment taller than 4ft (must be secured to the wall for earthquake safety), equipment that is too big/heavy for lab personnel to maneuver, any building modification (light bulb replacement, exposed wires, damaged counters/walls/windows etc.), or any equipment removal requests.

Use the link below to find the work request form:
https://med.stanford.edu/medfacilities/work-request.html

Building Access
As part of the Medical School we are issued badges as well as electronic key cards that can be programmed to grant access to Stanford buildings. This will be useful for coming in after hours (buildings are typically open 7am-7pm weekdays), on weekends, and on holidays, which may be necessary for personal or research purposes. This badge should be picked up as soon as possible after attending the Welcome Center orientation and receiving the appropriate form. Then you will need to fill out the Building Access Form and submit it along with proof of your training completion to XXX. 

Find the building access form here:

Lab Equipment Calendar
This calendar is used to sign up for blocks of time to use certain lab equipment that can become impacted when multiple people are running experiments. It’s run through Google Calendars. Please use it! Priority will be given to those that have properly reserved the equipment.

NOTE: An admin must add you to the calendar. The current admin is Gavin.

Capital Equipment
Capital equipment is any single item amounting to $5,000 or more. It is more closely regulated by the administration and must be issued a barcode tag. XXX is in charge of our capital equipment inventory and is the point of contact for getting new equipment registered. Valerie also manages our equipment removal requests.

Parking and Transportation
The closest parking area to the lab is either the Roth Way Lot, or the Stock Farm Lot, which doubles as the Marguerite Shuttle terminal. Use the Parking & Transportation Services website to purchase a long-term parking permit, explore your commute options, and join the Commute Club.

Find the Stock Farm Lot on Google Maps here:

WiFi
Stanford hosts multiple WiFi networks. To obtain access to “Stanford” or “Stanford Secure” (recommended) you must register your device with the Stanford network database (NetDB). Students and employees register differently - see the link below. Please note that you must use “Stanford Secure” if you have access to PHI on your device and that you will be denied access to the network if your device is not properly encrypted.

WiFi Info: https://uit.stanford.edu/service/wirelessnet

Ordering and Funding

The lab manager will be in charge of placing orders. However, individuals are still responsible for requesting items, keeping track of any order documents sent to them by companies, and putting away their items when they arrive.



For capital equipment and orders amounting to more than $1,000, obtain permission from Gavin before ordering.

Company Relationships
Orders placed through SmartMart go through to specific companies who will often reach back out to us (not necessarily just the lab manager) to confirm the items, price, and delivery date, and to send back data in the case of transactions such as sequencing. Any email correspondence, ESPECIALLY those that contain documents, should be forwarded or cc’d to the lab manager. We have had extensive billing issues in the past (especially with Novogene) that have been exacerbated by companies reaching out to multiple, even uninvolved people, lab members not saving emails and documents, exclusion of the lab manager, and generally poor communication with vendors. Please help us stop this from happening!

Grants and Funding
There is a “Grant Documents” folder on the Google Drive that contains NSF proposal examples and previously submitted proposals, and is a great place to post grant applications for editing.

Miscellany 

Letters of Recommendation
Gavin is happy to write you a letter of recommendation, but please give him fair warning and enough time to complete a thoughtful letter. It is useful to send Gavin a paragraph highlighting the project that you are proposing in the grant application, if appropriate, and always include an updated CV when you send him a request. He wants to write the best and most detailed letter of recommendation that he can for you. Because he writes many such letters per year, giving him fair warning ensures that he’ll have the time to write the best possible letter for you. 

Printers
The printer in our lab, backpack, is a color printer, and is outside Gavin’s office.

IP Address: XXX

Our Neighbors
It is important to be friendly and courteous to our neighbors. They are a great resource for collaboration, building/facilities questions, and borrowing materials and equipment.

Good Eats
The Stanford Campus has many cafes/restaurants/shops to purchase food for varying costs. Right out the door the CCSR Café makes great sandwiches; a five-minute walk is Coupa Café, which has authentic Venezuelan food along with Paninis and salads; Beckman (right next door) serves Starbucks coffee and the Clark Center houses a Peet’s. Tresidder is on the main campus just under a mile away and contains many eateries (Jamba Juice, Panda Express, Subway, etc.) as well as a small convenience store.
 
We also have awesome lab members that bring in treats and snacks, which we keep at XXX, and announce via slack channel #ding_snacks_are_ready.

Sherlock Lab Social Events
The Sherlock Lab puts on many events throughout the year - happy hours after CIG, a holiday party, board game nights and more. You are encouraged to attend these fun events, and if you have ideas for additional events, we’d love to hear them! 

Document History

This document was initially based on a lab expectations document from John Boothroyd, to which I made extensive revisions. I subsequently shared it with other Genetics department members, some of whom adopted it, and made many changes of their own. I adopted a substantial number of changes from Ami Bhatt.




EXAMPLE EXPECTATIONS:
I expect you to…

Performance expectations
* Your goal should be to Develop as a  self sufficient and independent scientist.
* Research the literature about your project and technologies you are using independently and on your own time
* Know our field, be an expert in your project.
* Participate in lab meetings and discussions, your responsibility is not just about your productivity, but helping your coworkers to improve their work.
* Demonstrate a commitment to your own learning and growth
* Curiosity and learning - you are not expected to know everything, you are expected to keep learning and to help others in the lab learn
* Manage your time.
* Making mistakes is a natural part of learning. Making the same mistake is not.  
Communication with Patrick
* I expect to connect with each member of the lab at least weekly.
* Large-scale experimental plans should be discussed before implementing them. 
* Please ask about purchases above $2,000.
* When experiments are not moving forward, talk to me so we can figure out what is going wrong.
* Discuss any potential data sharing with me. 

Research Products and Credit
* Authorship will be discussed among the people who do the work
* Ask for approval before submitting abstracts for meetings and presentations.
* Practice discretion when discussing results, we aren’t in competition with each other but we do have competitors. 
* Be especially respectful of others and do not share details of your colleagues’ work without their knowledge or permission. 

Maintaining a positive, collaborative and productive work environment and culture of success. 
* This lab should be a safe space for everyone. Be supportive and respectful to other lab members. 
* Be respectful of others (time, efforts, space, etc.)
* Success will be celebrated! 
* There will be absolutely no tolerance for discrimination, harassment, or disrespectful behavior. Once - we have a corrective conversation. Twice - we have a discussion about your future in the lab. Thrice - you will be asked to leave.
* Provide thoughtful and constructive feedback during lab meetings in a respectful manner
* Share responsibility for keeping all lab spaces safe, clean and organized
* To be respectful of others and the laboratory space. Be courteous, clean up after yourself and treat equipment with care. 
* Be honest, respectful, collaborative and collegial with other members of the lab.
* If the lab makes group decision, participate in and respect these group-adopted procedures.
* Our lab is a collaborative environment, not a competitive one. We should all strive to create a culture of success. 
* Treating all members of the lab community--students, post-docs, administrative staff, building staff, PI--with respect and consideration is a priority. Intentional effort is made, and specific time is dedicated to, maintaining and improving fulfillment of this goal. Respect and consideration include but are not limited to: (i) a deeply-held belief that a person is a professional and personal equal, and worth listening to, and (ii) taking initiative to complete "fair share" of administrative responsibilities 
Support team mates
* Be engaged with other people’s science. Actively listen and participate in group meeting (or after) so that people know that they are supported and encouraged by the team.
* Be respectful of people’s time and schedules. For instance, if you are not an early person and being trained by someone who is, try to work with their schedule. If this may pose a problem, discuss openly at the beginning.
* Be generous -  Mostly with other lab members - share time, knowledge and reagents. Dedicate time to guide others to avoid your past mistakes. 
* Collaborative, help/mentor each other with learning new techniques, solving problems; inform each other about new techniques/publications that may help with any project in the lab
* Your labmates’ successes reflect well on you, and one person struggling can affect the whole lab. It is critical that you are open to to providing assistance and training to other members of the lab when they need it, and to celebrate the accomplishments of your labmates. 
Be prompt
* Show up for meetings on time or communicate by email/slack if you are running late.
* Show up for appointments and meetings on time. 
* Equipment is shared and being respectful to your lab mates means using the equipment only when you have reserved it and not going over on your time. 
* Do not be late for lab meetings or other commitments.
* Give as much notice as possible if you need to cancel or reschedule a meeting
* Be around during normal work hours, unless we have agreed upon an alternative schedule, and discuss/request time off with me ahead of time 
Manage conflict
* In a professional situation don’t talk disparage the lab or lab members. If you find yourself complaining often about the lab, come talk to me and we can try and solve the issues. 
* If you have an issue with another lab member and you don’t feel comfortable addressing it directly, use Patrick (or other LVD PI’s if necessary) as a moderator to address the issue.

Speak up
* To communicate to me if something (including me!) is preventing you from being productive AND happy in the lab.
* Ask for and provide feedback both scientific and behavioral
* Feel comfortable coming to me with any questions, concerns, or issues that come up in the lab, including major mistakes that we all inevitably make
* My goal is that you feel like you are able to ask questions, at any stage of your training. I am here to help you.
* Be clear about what you need me to do - make specific requests by email when these are time-sensitive
* Ask questions when problems arise (providing one has thought about potential solutions first). There are no stupid questions… However, there are questions that need to be thought about carefully first, as the answers may already be apparent, especially if questions are about topics that have already been discussed multiple times. 
Practice self-care
* To work hard and make progress on your research/career goals while remembering to take care of yourself physically and mentally. 
* A work-life balance is important to keep you motivated and moving towards your goals. At certain points you need to spend more time and energy in lab to reach a goal and at other times you need to step back and recharge. Do what you need to do to be healthy and to get your work done and progress.
* Let me know when important things are happening in your life that may affect your work. It will happen. I will understand.  
Logistics & safety
* Be mindful of reagents that are shared, reorder when things are getting low.
* Keep your workspace clean and tidy - especially at the end of the day / while on vacation.
* Participate and volunteer for lab tasks so that some people don’t have to shoulder the burden of logistics unfairly.
* ALWAYS clean shared areas/equipment after usage and LOG OFF from computers after you are done.
* Wear appropriate PPE when you are in the lab.
* Be careful with spending, respect the time you reserved for instruments. Do not waste reagents
* Do not eat or drink in the lab. In other words, no coffee while in the lab.
* Know procedures for working with dangerous chemicals or biological agents or know who to ask when confused. 
Record keeping
* I will specify whether I want a hardcopy or electronic Notebook and what I expect the person to submit before they leave the lab, e.g. inventory of plasmids, glycerol stocks, chemicals etc. or specific protocols/procedures.
* Back-up your data regularly
* Create and share documentation of your work, including version tracking and data cleaning/analysis syntax
* Practice good record-keeping
* Keep good record of all your data, samples collected, etc in an organized and easy to follow so future staff who would pick up the project will be able to follow through and utilize the info or materials from you when you leave the lab.

Accountability
* When working remotely, respond to emails that ask questions within [2 hours/end of day/2 business days] and signal in the subject line when you need a sooner response
* Follow through with tasks and projects you state you are going to do
* To work regularly on your project/responsibilities. You don’t have to keep a 9-5 schedule but you should be coming into lab every day during the work week.
* Although I am flexible about lab hours, I prefer to have people arrive around 9:30AM.
* Responsible for knowing your own work style and being flexible enough to adapt to what is needed for the specific project you are working on 
Integrity and ethics
* I expect for you to bring up any shortcomings, errors, failed experiments, to your direct supervisor as soon as the problems arise so we can try to solve it asap and minimize the consequences
* Be honest about failures and data.
* Avoid but accept mistakes, be transparent and talk about it, find a way to solve them
* Be responsible - Take ownership of your success, as well as your failures. It is expected that most pilot experiments fail, but learning from them will make the experience invaluable.
* You should be honest and open in your communication. At any time if you notice a mistake, you should bring that my attention immediately.
* Be honest with your data and always communicate how exactly and how often you did the experiment
