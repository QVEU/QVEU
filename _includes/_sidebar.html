		<h3>Mission</h3>
		<p>
The <b>mission</b> of the QVEU is to explore questions related to virus evolution, emergence, and pathogenesis through rigorous quantitative experiments and computational biology.

<br><br>The three concepts that motivate the lab are:<br>
<b>Heterogeneity</b> - how do diversity and selection in viral and host cell populations affect the outcome of infection and evolution?<br>
<b>Constraint</b> - what are the forces (biological, genetic, or biophysical) that shape evolutionary processes?<br>
<b>History</b> - how can historical data (either measured or inferred computationally) inform our experiments into viral diversification and emergence?<br>
